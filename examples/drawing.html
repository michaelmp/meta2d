        // This demonstration introduces the Layer.draw method. The draw method takes
        // a drawing as an argument. And it does not appear on the screen until the
        // layer has rendered the drawing to its backbuffer and flips buffers.
        //
        // You should have already read layer.html and entity.html.

        var mcx = meta2d.create('demo', {
          w: 400,
          h: 300
        });

        mcx.save();
        mcx.translate(50, 50);

        mcx.restore();

        // A drawing is an object with two properties:
        //   ctx : A new Context for a hidden canvas with the specified width and
        //         height in makeDrawing.
        //
        //   transform : The [a, b, c, d, e, f] values that define the transformation
        //               matrix.
        //
        // You make a drawing from a layer (here, we use the default active layer),
        // and this sets transform to a copy of the active layer's transformation
        // matrix.
        //
        // d.transform is a matrix representation of the translate and rotate
        // operations that were on the stack when we made the drawing.
        // 
        // d.ctx has its own state, initialized to the identity matrix like any other
        // Context upon construction.
        //
        // The purpose of keeping an individual transform is that we can now treat
        // d.ctx.canvas as a rectangular bitmap without worrying about where it is
        // drawn on the screen.

        d.ctx.fillStyle = 'black';
        d.ctx.fillRect(0, 0, 50, 50);

        // The memo operation sets aside a rectangle in screen coordinates, on which
        // drawings will be received.
        //
        // In Meta2D, the backbuffer is whatever rectangles you specify with memo,
        // even if they extend beyond the visible screen.

        mcx.memo(50, 0, 350, 300);
        mcx.memo(0, 0, 50, 85);

        // The draw operation takes a drawing and draws it onto memo-ed regions after
        // applying the drawing's transform property to the current transformation
        // matrix.
        //
        // Note that because memo takes screen coordinates without consideration for
        // transformations, the draw command does not take into account the current
        // transformation state, only the drawing's transform.
        //
        // So mcx.translate(5000, 5000) right here would not affect mcx.draw(d)
        // because d has already copied the transform.

        mcx.draw(d);

        // The term "flip" typically means to swap buffers in a traditional multi-
        // buffer rendering pipeline. Here, our buffers are radically different:
        //
        //   - The backbuffer is a set of canvases at arbitrary locations specified
        //     by memo().
        //
        //   - The frontbuffer is a single canvas apppended to the HTML document when
        //     the layer is created.
        //
        // The flip operation copies any backbuffer "blocks" that intersect with
        // the frontbuffer canvas using the 'copy' globalCompositeOperation. It is
        // therefore unspecified what happens when you memo overlapping blocks
        // (although this will usually just cause redundant work).

        mcx.flip();

        // If you're wondering why the backbuffer is allowed to extend beyond the
        // bounds of the frontbuffer, a later demonstration will show how to pan
        // around those offscreen blocks with a layer camera.

        // The output should look like a diamond with the bottom-left corner cut out:
        //
        // +------------+
        // |            |
        // |   #        |

        // |            |
        // +------------+

        // Further reading:
        //   Now that we know how to use drawings, we're going to look at performance
        //   improvements on our double-buffer system in cache1.html.
