        // This demonstration looks into the details of how the 'ondraw' method
        // is used in the rendering model. Although this method has access to a
        // context to perform direct rendering instructions, it is wasteful to repeat
        // these instructions when the entity is redrawn identically many times.
        // Similarly, multiple entities may want to use the same bitmap, differing
        // only in position, rotation, scaling, etc.
        //
        // So let's make a scene with lots of entities and try to cut the
        // rendering time down to a minimum.

        // Rather than doing the path drawings in 'ondraw', let's make a distinct
        // context for a shared bitmap. A 'Context' creates a hidden canvas of
        // the given width & height and returns a Meta2D's version of the 2d
        // context. It is identical to a typical 2d context, but it also has a
        // getTransform method that returns the current transformation state.

        var bitmap = new meta2d.Context(200, 100);

        // How about a cloud? (This is the limit of my vector art abilities).

        bitmap.moveTo(20, 100);

        // Ok, now let's define 'ondraw'.
        //
        // We have previously been defining ondraw as a list of Context commands that
        // immediately update the canvas. But we already know what we want our cloud
        // to look like (we drew it on  the "bitmap" context) so why should we repeat
        // the commands for every cloud? But we also want every cloud to appear at its
        // own position, and "bitmap" doesn't know about each cloud's position.
        //
        // drawing.html introduced drawings. You should read it if you haven't.
        //
        // Calling a layer's makeDrawing command will return a "Drawing," which is
        // really just a context alongside a snapshot of the current transformation
        // state in the layer's context (we use getTransform, as mentioned above).
        //
        // So in addition to the entity's position, any transformations you make in
        // ondraw to the context will affect the Drawing.
        //
        // Finally, returning a Drawing in ondraw will get it drawn with the
        // appropriate transformation when we call the "render" command.
        //
        // This may seem a little weird, but encapsulating the entity inside a
        // single bitmap allows us to do a lot of nice things later.

        // Note that by specifying a value for e.draw, we can indicate that we do not
        // need to call ondraw again since the return value never changes. So we will
        // only invoke ondraw once per entity, when draw is undefined.
        //
        // If we need to, we can always delete e.draw and e.ondraw will be called
        // again.
        //
        // So using the "draw" property instead of ondraw is the first way that we
        // can improve performance.

        // We then convert that offset into a cycle of positive size values.
        //
        // We use the size as a key for our cache.

        // If we find the bitmap we're looking for in cache, we use it.
        //
        // If not, we create a new drawing, use its context to draw the star, and
        // store the bitmap inside the cache.
        //
        // Keep in mind that we are cacheing the context, not the drawing. The
        // drawing refers to the context in its .ctx property, but it also knows the
        // current transformation state (.transform), which is different for every
        // entity (every star has its own translation based on its .pos value).
        //
        // Calling layer.makeDrawing(hit) as opposed to specifying width & height
        // arguments means that you already have a context, but you just need the
        // transform property applied.
        //
        // The return line uses a little bit of Javascript magic to say:
        //   "return a drawing of the hit context if it was present, otherwise return
        //    the penta drawing."

        // Assume that because we have 100+ entities with bitmaps, that's potentially
        // a lot of memory. Fortunately we were able to cache all of our bitmaps, but
        // tougher applications will want to scale up and animate their entities
        // making it more difficult for CPUs to keep up. Those considerations and an
        // explanation of the memo/memoAll commands are deferred to cache2.html and

        // backbuffer inside coordinates specified by memo calls.
        //
        // If you want to see what's in the back buffer, you flip it to the front
        // buffer. In this example all of our relevant content fits within 400x300,
