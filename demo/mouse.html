  // We're going to use drawings as a way of providing an alpha-masked

  // We will invert the drawing's transform to send the mouse coordinates
  // to bitmap coordinates and check whether the bitmap is opaque at that
  // pixel.

    // Once we've set a mask, we can listen to click, mousemove, mouseover,
    // mouseout, etc.
    //
    // Here, we will clear the saved drawing and call render/flip in the
    // local area of the screen, as determined by the drawing's bounding
    // rectangle computed in getBounds().
    
    e.onmousemove = function() {
      if (!e.draw) return;

  mcx.render(0, 0, mcx.getWidth(), mcx.getHeight());
  mcx.flip(0, 0, mcx.getWidth(), mcx.getHeight());

  // prune() removes all memos in the active layer.
  //
  // This is necessary since we are about to create a new memo that would
  // overlap the old memo.
  //
  // resize() affects all layers and replaces the canvases inserted into the
  // page with newly sized ones. It is a good idea to redraw the complete
  // scene after resizing.

  var resize = function() {
    mcx.prune();
    mcx.resize(window.innerWidth, window.innerHeight);
    mcx.memo(0, 0, mcx.getWidth(), mcx.getHeight());
    repaint_stars([0, 0, mcx.getWidth(), mcx.getHeight()]);
  };

  window.onresize = resize;

  // As a bonus, let's go one step farther and speed things up.
  //
  // You will notice (depending on your browser and hardware) the mouseover
  // effect demonstrated here begin to slow down as you increase the number of
  // stars. Note that we are only repainting the smallest necessary region of
  // the screen (this would be even slower if we were redrawing the entire
  // scene).
  //
  // This is primarily because the mousemove event requires us to check the
  // masking property of every entity, including time for z sorting.
  //
  // This obviously isn't necessary if we know in advance where are entities
  // are located via a spatial partitioning or similar. Fortunately, every
  // layer has this functionality.

  // The 'bound' event is internally defined as when the layer would like to
  // know where an entity is going to be drawn without drawing it.
  //
  // Here, the stars are not moving, so we can set .bound and never change it.

  mcx.select('star').forEach(function(e) {
    e.onbound = function() {
      if (!e.draw) return;
      return e.bound = e.draw.getBounds();
    };
  });

  // Finally, let's inform the layer that the bound is available and that it
  // should use the bound whenever possible.
  //
  // We do this with the index() method.

  mcx.index();

  // Try running the demo with the index() line commented out to see the
  // improvement.
  //
  // Just to recap, we have many 200x200 pixel bitmaps scattered around a
  // full screen and we're able to get pretty responsive mouse events.
  //
  // Try increasing the number of stars to 50, 100... 500.
  //
  // I wrote this demo with the following specs as my benchmark:
  //  - 2x 1.5GHz netbook, 1GB RAM.
  //  - Firefox 7 in Debian Linux.
  //  - 1440x900 external SVGA.
  //
  // I was able to run 1000+ stars before getting significant lag in FF.
  // Chrome was noticeably slower above 500.
  //
  // Good performance with index() reflects the density of the entities. If
  // they're stack on top of each other, then things will be slow. If they're
  // spread apart, then things will be pretty fast.

  // Further reading:
  //
  //   If we were to move our stars around, we would need to update the bounds
  //   and inform the layer that the old bounds were out of date. This involves
  //   updating the tree datastructure storing all of these bounds.
  //
  //   The reindex(x, y, w, h) method updates any dirty bounds in the specified
  //   screen area.
  //
  //   cache3.html will look at this in greater depth.
  //
  // Until then, please read cache2.html to learn more about the backbuffer. In
  // that demo we will draw offscreen and pan around using a camera.
